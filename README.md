# Application Workflow Website
## CirclePe Frontend Assignment
### Overview
This project demonstrates the workflow of an application using animations to guide users through various steps. It is built with React and leverages Framer Motion for fluid animations. The website is fully responsive, providing an engaging and dynamic user experience across different devices.
### Tools and Technologies
* React: Used for building the user interface and managing component states.
* Framer Motion: Applied for animations, transitions, and micro-interactions.
* Tailwind CSS: Used for styling the website with consistency and modularity.
* CSS Modules: For localized styling and maintaining scoping.
* Responsive Design: Ensuring the website works seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
### Key Features
* Animations: Each component, including arrows, circles, and phone images, transitions smoothly between different states using Framer Motion. This adds fluidity to the user experience.
* Responsiveness: The layout adjusts based on screen size, ensuring that the user experience is optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
* Cross-browser compatibility: The website has been tested and is compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
* Performance Optimization: Images are optimized for faster load times, and unnecessary scripts are minimized to ensure good performance on slower network connections.
* Accessibility: The project follows accessibility best practices, with semantic HTML and proper ARIA roles.
### Challenges Faced and Solutions
1. Animating Multiple Components:
- Challenge: Handling the complex sequence of animations for multiple components such as arrows, circles, and phones.
- Solution: Framer Motion was utilized to control the sequence of animations using asynchronous functions to ensure smooth transitions.
2. Responsive Design for Complex Animations:
* Challenge: Ensuring animations and layouts work well on different screen sizes.
* Solution: Media queries and React state management were used to adjust the animation parameters dynamically based on the screen size.
3. Cross-browser Compatibility:
* Challenge: Ensuring animations and CSS styles behave consistently across browsers.
* Solution: CSS was thoroughly tested on multiple browsers and adjusted to avoid inconsistencies.
